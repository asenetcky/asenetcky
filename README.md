## About Me:

I am a Data Scientist and an Epidemiologist working in Hartford, CT.  I am  passionate about
the R programming language, Linux and other free and open-source software (FOSS).  I both enjoy and strive to bring 
many of the amazing qualities that encompass FOSS to my little neck of the woods in state government.  It is my hope
to make the data we use for decision making, and the tooling surrounding all of that more open and reproducible.

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the `distiller` and `strata` R packages
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust

## Public Health

After my MPH I got my start in Public Health working at the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) as an Epidemiologist, 
where I currently work as a Data Scientist.  

I started out working in Syndromic Surveillance on near-realtime emergency department events, where I was involved with
surveillance and syndrome creation and refinement.  Most of that work orbited around the use of data surrounding the 
Opioid Epidemic and refinement of the syndromes related to that subject area and other illicit substances.  
I've also developed syndromes for Suicidal Ideation (and related-modifiers like intentionality), 
Suspected Carbon Monoxide Poisoning and others. During this time I primarily used R and it's suite of machine learning, 
regex and natural language processing tools.  

During the pandemic I switched to daily reporting on the Covid-19 to the Governor's office, CT public and our CT Open Data Portal.
It was during this time that the team and I helped usher in an age at DPH of broader use of automation, 
Data Science, and data pipelines to deliver timely information to key stakeholders and reduce the considerable burden on DPH staff.
