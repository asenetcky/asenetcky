## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:

I am a Data Scientist and an Epidemiologist working in Hartford, CT.  I am  passionate about
the R programming language, Linux and other free and open-source software (FOSS).  I both enjoy and strive to bring 
many of the amazing qualities that encompass FOSS to my little neck of the woods in state government.  It is my hope
to make the data we use for decision making, and the tooling surrounding all of that more open and reproducible.

  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the `distiller` and `strata` R packages
  - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust
